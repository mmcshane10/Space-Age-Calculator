#### Application to determine your age and life expectancy on other planets, 09/6/2019

#### By Mike McShane

## Description

The application takes in a user's sex and age and then determines their age on other planets in our solar system based on those planet's solar year length. The application will also return the user's remaining life expectancy on each planet. If their age is already past the life expectancy value, it will return the number of years they have already outlived the expectancy.
